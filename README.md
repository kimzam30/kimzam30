# Hi there, I'm Hakim (kimzam) ! 👋

I am an **IT Student**, **Full-Stack Developer**, and **Security-Focused Developer**.

I don't just write code; I build the environments it runs on. My work bridges the gap between high-performance hardware and resilient software, specializing in secure, low-latency architectures from the kernel up to the UI.

- 🐳 **Homelab Architect:** Designing self-hosted, automated infrastructure using Docker & Linux.
- 🌑 **Project Nera:** A zero-dependency, vanilla JS message prompting engine.
- 🐧 **Linux Daily Driver:** 100% transitioned to Linux for development, prioritizing terminal mastery.
- 🦋 **Butterfly Word Search:** A secure, real-time multiplayer game engine.
- 🛡️ **Researching:** Network Penetration Testing & Secure API Architecture.
- ⚡ **Deep Dive:** Mastering **C++ Systems Programming** (Memory Management & Hardware Interaction).

### 🐧 The Linux Transition & Infrastructure
I believe in **"Data Sovereignty"** and **"Infrastructure as Code."** I have moved away from proprietary "black box" OSs to a fully Linux-driven workflow to mirror production environments.

* **Daily Driver:** Developing on Linux allows me to deepen my understanding of C++ memory management, kernel interaction, and system hardening.
* **The Private Cloud:** I operate a **Windows-based NAS** configured for high-performance remote access, allowing me to code and deploy from anywhere without relying solely on public clouds.
* **Secure Mesh:** Using **Tailscale (WireGuard)**, I maintain a flat, encrypted mesh network, removing the need for risky port forwarding.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🐳 [Automated Homelab Infrastructure](https://github.com/kimzam30/my-docker-setup)
**"Infrastructure as Code in Action."**
* **The Architecture:** A fully containerized homelab environment orchestrated via **Docker Compose** on Linux.
* **The Stack:** Features **Pi-hole v6** for network-wide ad blocking, **Homepage** for a centralized dashboard, and **File Browser** for remote management.
* **Security First:** Implemented **Secrets Management** (via environment variables/.gitignore) and a custom **Nginx Reverse Proxy** to route traffic securely without exposing internal ports.
* **Connectivity:** Integrated into my Tailscale mesh network for secure, zero-trust remote access.

#### 📡 [Remote Dev Setup With NAS](https://github.com/kimzam30/RemoteDevSetupWithNAS)
**"The Private Cloud. Decoupling development from hardware."**
* **The Concept:** My laptop acts as a "thin client," while my NAS serves as the central repository and build server.
* **Redundancy & Sync:** Automated scripts sync dotfiles and configurations, ensuring my environment is instantly recoverable if my laptop breaks.
* **Tech Used:** Tailscale, Windows Server, SMB/SSH, PowerShell scripting.

#### 🌑 [Project Nera](https://github.com/kimzam30/Project-Nera)
**"Power in Simplicity."**
* **The Goal:** To prove that modern UI doesn't need heavy frameworks.
* **The Tech:** 100% Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. **Zero Dependencies.**
* **The Value:** A plug-and-play notification system that is lightweight, fast, and secure by design, eliminating the attack surface of third-party NPM packages.

#### 🦋 [Butterfly Word Search](https://github.com/kimzam30/butterfly-word-search)
**Secure Real-time Multiplayer Gaming.**
* **The Challenge:** Handling state synchronization between multiple clients while preventing cheating.
* **The Solution:** Leveraged **Firebase Real-time Database** combined with strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** security rules to validate every move server-side.
