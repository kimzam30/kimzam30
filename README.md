# Hi there, I'm Hakim (kimzam) ! 👋

I am an **IT Student**, **Full-Stack Developer**, and **Security-Focused Developer**.

I don't just write code; I build the environments it runs on. My work bridges the gap between high-performance hardware and resilient software, specializing in secure, low-latency architectures from the kernel up to the UI.

- 🌑 **Project Nera:** A zero-dependency, vanilla JS message prompting engine.
- 🐧 **Linux Daily Driver:** 100% transitioned to Linux for development, prioritizing terminal mastery.
- 🦋 **Butterfly Word Search:** A secure, real-time multiplayer game engine.
- 🛡️ **Researching:** Network Penetration Testing & Secure API Architecture.
- ⚡ **Deep Dive:** Mastering **C++ Systems Programming** (Memory Management & Hardware Interaction).

### 🐧 The Linux Transition & Infrastructure
I believe in **"Data Sovereignty"** and **"Infrastructure as Code."** I have moved away from proprietary "black box" OSs to a fully Linux-driven workflow to mirror production environments.

* **Daily Driver:** Developing on Linux allows me to deepen my understanding of C++ memory management, kernel interaction, and system hardening.
* **The Private Cloud:** I operate a **Windows-based NAS** configured for high-performance remote access, allowing me to code and deploy from anywhere without relying solely on public clouds.
* **Secure Mesh:** Using **Tailscale (WireGuard)**, I maintain a flat, encrypted mesh network, removing the need for risky port forwarding.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 📡 [Remote Dev Setup With NAS](https://github.com/kimzam30/RemoteDevSetupWithNAS)
**"The Private Cloud. A self-hosted infrastructure project that decouples my development environment from physical hardware."**
* **The Architecture:** My laptop acts as a "thin client," while my Windows-based NAS serves as the central repository and build server.
* **Secure Connectivity:** Utilizes Tailscale (WireGuard protocol) to create a mesh network, allowing me to mount drives and push code securely from any network (coffee shop, university, etc.) without port forwarding.
* **Redundancy & Sync:** Implements automated scripts to sync dotfiles, configurations, and repositories, ensuring that if my laptop breaks, my environment is instantly recoverable from the NAS.
* **Tech Used:** Tailscale, Windows Server/10, SMB/SSH, Git, Bash/PowerShell scripting.

#### 🌑 [Project Nera](https://github.com/kimzam30/Project-Nera)
**"Power in Simplicity."**
* **The Goal:** To prove that modern UI doesn't need heavy frameworks.
* **The Tech:** 100% Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. **Zero Dependencies.**
* **The Value:** A plug-and-play notification system that is lightweight, fast, and secure by design, eliminating the attack surface of third-party NPM packages.

#### 🦋 [Butterfly Word Search](https://github.com/kimzam30/butterfly-word-search)
**Secure Real-time Multiplayer Gaming.**
* **The Challenge:** Handling state synchronization between multiple clients while preventing cheating.
* **The Solution:** Leveraged **Firebase Real-time Database** combined with strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** security rules to validate every move server-side.
